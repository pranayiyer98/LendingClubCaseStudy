# Lending Club Case Study
> The company, specialising in consumer finance, focuses on offering various loan products to urban customers. When a loan application is received, the company must decide whether to approve it based on the applicantâ€™s profile. Two key risks are associated with this decision:
    If the applicant is likely to repay the loan and the loan is not approved, the company experiences lost business opportunities.
    If the applicant is unlikely to repay the loan (i.e., likely to default), approving the loan could result in financial losses for the company.

## General Information
- Project Background: This Case study is part of Upgrad - MLC67 July Course
- Business Problem: 
    The goal is to identify the key factors that contribute to loan defaults, i.e., the variables that serve as strong indicators of default risk. This insight will support the company's portfolio and risk management processes.
    The objective is to identify high-risk loan applicants. Reducing the approval of such loans will minimize credit losses. This case study aims to achieve this objective using exploratory data analysis (EDA).
- What is the dataset that is being used?
    Loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 t0 2011.


## Conclusions
- Applicants with higher DTI are more likely to default on loans.
- Lower grades means higher risk
- Interest rates increases with lower grades
- Applicants with higher grades are less risky.
